Welcome to my new tech blog!

Following [Lorna Jane Mitchell's advice](http://www.lornajane.net/posts/2011/make-blogging-your-new-years-resolution) I made blogging into a new year's resolution... two and a half years ago. Two full new-years later, I've long since convinced myself of the benefits of this practice; writing for mental relief, personal reference, publicity, etc. I've just never made the time to dive in until now. I'm excited to finally get started.

I'm not really doing this to attract an audience, though if this blog lends me a bit of credability to future employers or the web developer community in general I'd consider it a nice bonus. The real purpose of this blog is to enhance my own professional development.

Maintaining this blog will help me accomplish several things at once:

- Enhance my writing skills
- Externalize my mind/memory
- Learn new skills through teaching — *even if there's no audience*
- Reflect on and organize my thoughts
- Engage in the developer community
- Exercise discipline in writing regularly
- Publicise myself — *there's only so much a short bio or résumé can tell you about me; writing about my vocation allows me to demonstrate my grasp of the technologies I use.*

I plan to cover a range of topics from software and technology, to productivity hacking, and a little bit of personal philosophy.

### Externalizing My Brain

[![Getting Things Done](/img/posts/getting-things-done.jpg){: width=200 .pull-right}](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done)

A few years back I adopted [David Allen's GTD system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done) and it's transformed the way I manage my workload. I'll probably write about it in a future post. One of the main takeaways from his philosophy is that a great deal of stress and inefficiency comes when you try to hold onto too many threads in your mind. By externalizing as much of your [brain's working memory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_load) into a trusted system, you can stop your brain from nagging you with unrelated thoughts while you try to focus on a particular subject.

While using this blog as a "mind dump" for ideas and technical tutorials won't profoundly effect my *working memory* in the same way putting my projects and tasks into a task management system would, I think it will allow me to relax my *long term memory* in a similar fashion.

In this profession, I wear a lot of hats and I balance a lot of skillsets. I may use a library like [cURL](http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/) for a small one-off project, or use [Chef](http://www.opscode.com/chef/) to customize my server environment for a customer, or run into some quirky syntax in a programming language I occasionally use, and then never use that knowledge again until 12 months later. If I document these experiences in writing, I not only have a better chance of retaining my acquired knowledge, I don't really have to remember it at all:

> "The things that were once in my brain – now Google can find them!"

Since everything I write is public and indexable, all I have to do is look back into my blog history or Google it. This blog will serve as my second external brain.

### Writing Regularly

Expressive writing has been shown to improve working memory, writing skills, thought organization, and a [host of other things](http://www.bakadesuyo.com/2012/03/10-ways-a-little-bit-of-writing-can-solve-all/). I'm actually doubling down on this idea. In addition to this long-form tech blog, I'm starting a [personal Tumblr blog](http://mike.greiling.me/) to act as a personal [diet blog](http://mike.greiling.me/post/55604956607/starting-a-diet-blog) and to let me [segregate the posts about movies, hobbies, and politics](http://mike.greiling.me/post/52971455914/hello-world) from the more focused vocational stuff found here.

I think forcing myself to write regularly will require some discipline. My intent is to blog something at least twice per month. We'll see how well I manage to keep up.

It should be an interesting ride. Thanks for tuning in.

#Process Spotlight: Standup

One key aspect of our agile process is our morning standup. It happens every morning at the same time in the same place. It is our simple daily routine that continues to produce great results. The team uses these 15 minutes to talk through the status of current projects by answer three questions:

####What did I do yesterday?
####What will I do today?
####What is keeping me from getting work done?

The goal of these questions is to maintain transparency and provide more useful information than a review of a teammate’s calendar would provide. Also, with consultants and project managers working on multiple projects simultaneously, it helps team members take a step back and gain insight into what we are doing as a whole. To achieve these goals and remain as focused as possible, we offer three tips from our own experience to help you get the most out of a daily standup.

 1. Consider the **most important thing** you need to accomplish today. While very easy to say, this can actually be a pretty difficult step. We can easily rattle off a list of three things that need to get done today. But if you could only do one, what would it be? Use this “most important thing” to prioritize what you get done early in your day.
    
 2. Remember that **a gripe about a difficult problem is not the same as a plea for help**. Standup provides a time to vocalize frustrations, annoyances, and things that just aren’t going as well as they could or should. Naturally, a well-established, nurturing team will want to lend a helping hand during tough times. When in this situation, we try to remember that unsolicited advice tends to be unwelcome. Being told what to do, even when intentions are good, robs us of our freedom. And without the freedom to explore creative solution, difficult problems become impossible. Instead, we must remember to first ask if a team member needs or wants help before jumping in with a proposed solution. When someone does need help, one of our favorite things is the ability to do “just in time” discussions right after standup to talk through the problem at hand.
    
    
 3. Finally, **be prepared, be present, and listen**. In concrete terms, this means that all team members need to be in the office (or online when a staff member is remote) prior to the start of the standup, know (and are able to discuss) what their day looks like, and give their full attention to the person talking.

While standup is just one piece of our overall process, it has improved our internal communication, made our team more flexible, and generally helped us produce higher quality work.

Not bad for 15 minutes a day.
