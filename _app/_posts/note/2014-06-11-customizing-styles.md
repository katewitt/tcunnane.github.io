You can customize the basic look and feel without touching the theme files by changing `custom.js` and `custom.less`:

```
├── _app/
|   ├── assets/
|   |   └── _js/
|   |   |   └── custom.js
|   |   └── _less/
|   |   |   └── custom.less
|   |   └── themes/
|   |   |   └── ...
```

These files won't be overwritten when you update Almace Scaffolding or update your themes.
